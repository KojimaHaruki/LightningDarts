## Welcome to Lightning Darts!

My name is Haruki Kojima. 
I'm a student that belongs to Suzuki Lab., Dept. of mechanical systems engineering, Nagoya University, Japan. 
In our laboratory, we enjoy playing darts, but we have a darts board without any sensors.
Moreover, we play darts games with recording the progress on a whiteboard, which is inconvenient.  
Then, I started developing Lightning Darts with DX library for C++.
This project works on Visual Studio 2022. 
If you wanna build this project, download DX library and set environment.
The easier way to use this app is just clicking on LightningDarts.exe.
Firstly, I'm sorry that this application is uncompleted, but you can play some games for now.
